<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>My name is Alexander Czigler, welcome to my website.</p>
<p>
	I work as a developer at <a href="https://seb.se" target="_blank">SEB</a> mainly focusing on building
	API's and infrastructure-as-code. My current focus is improving my TypeScript skills, learning GCP
	and leveraging a GitOps approach to infrastructure and applications deployments using Terraform and
	FluxCD.
</p>

<p>
	Before joining SEB I have gained over 15 years experience as a consultant working with a wide
	range of technologies and customers in different industries. If you are interested in my
	professional experience, check out my
